INFO - NameOfCharacterAndDetailsUnder = [ MWE ]
Female, 26-29 years old. Once a superstar solo artist, she's now beginning her career descent at the ripe age of 28. Ambitious, deeply insecure, defined by fame - she was raised to be a star and is fully a creature of the pop machine. She needs a killer voice, charisma for days, and an ocean of subtext - she's a Wagnerian heroine in a steel box. Looking for actresses with a large vocal range and a range-y chest voice. An amazing belter. OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ SONOMA ]
Female, 16-28 years old. The star. The Beyonce to the D Child. She was raised by two doctor parents who have no qualms about her daughter's specialness. Lessons from the age of 3. Piano, voice, dance. Only child. Duh. And daddy’s little girl. In and out of school, the straight A perfect student. Ruthless. Some might say fake. She prefers ambitious and savvy. Plucked by Moon to be the next solo artist. He rebrands her as SONOMA. OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ TINY D ]
Female, 16-28 years old. Second in command. The smallest. Hence, her name. Also the oldest by 2 years. Used to be a reality TV star. Not a great one because she’s really honest, earnest. Broke into SPECIALK by auditioning six times for Moon and Ruby. Wants everything bad. She is dying to be a breakout solo star, but will never be one. She’s designated to become the new uhn-ni of the group (the leader). OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ MINA ]
Female, 16-28 years old. Princess. She has what we call gong-ju-byoung (Princess Disease). Convinced parents to give her her first eyelid surgery when she was 13. Spends about $1000 a week on her face. She’s about as smart as plankton. Interests include: shopping, nails, and fur. She can hit it, though. Hits every dance move, every note. She’s not particularly good. But she’s reliable. OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ XO ]
Female, 16-28 years old. The hip-hop girl. The bad girl. The girl who used to be a stripper. The girl whose stripper pictures leak and who now must leave the group. Maybe. Also the only girl who has ever had it hard. An orphan. A former addict. An ex-everything, really. Ex-con, ex-thief, ex-stripper, ex-dealer. She really lives up to her reputation. OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ SHEEN ]
Female, 16-28 years old. The butch one. Sporty Spice, but on steroids. She can’t dance for shit, much less give a good interview. But she’s kind and she’s got a good head on her shoulders and she is often the voice or reason. The reason why she’s kept around is that she is a great songwriter. OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ CALLIE ]
Female, 16-28 years old. The dancer. Sexy sexy sexy. She can move like nobody else’s business. Her behavior, though, has been erratic as of late. She’s showing up late to rehearsals. Faking sicknesses. It’s unclear what’s going on. Callie has a secret. Everyone’s little sis. OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ 1-NA (PRONOUNCED HANNAH). ]
Female, 16-28 years old. The fun one. She’s the one who will have a long career after SPECIALK as a talk show announcer. Bubbly, witty, smart. Used to be an engineering major. Wears around goggles and takes ironic selfies. OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ BING BING ]
Female, 16-28 years old. The Americanized one. Used to live in LA. One of those L.A. Korean girls. Has an ulterior motive: wants to be a big Hollywood star. She thinks breaking into America is going to pave the way for her acting career. Thinks she can be the next big Asian movie star. Except, those don’t exist. OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ JIN-HEE ]
Female, 16-28 years old. Has just returned from nodes surgery. Used to be a vocal force, now can’t really sing. Fragile – both emotionally and physically. She’s broken every bone. Gets ill a lot. Can’t really handle life. OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ EPIC ]
Male, 16-28 years old. Hyung. The leader. He is perfect. Just… perfection. Like, there is nothing else to say except he is perfection. Imagine a perfect human being, and then up the perfection factor by ten. And then imagine if this perfect human made a horrible, horrible mistake. A mistake that might cost the group everything. OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ HHH (TRIPLE H) ]
Male, 16-28 years old. Richie Rich. Comes from an incredible amount of wealth. His father is on the board of Samsung wealth. He is global 1% and has no qualms about it. He tries to distance himself from his upbringing to preserve his image, but has no qualms using his dad’s credit cards. OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ TIMMY X ]
Male, 16-28 years old. The bad boy. He break dances. He raps. He can’t really sing, but it doesn’t matter because he has cool hair and makes panties flutter. He is the Bobby Brown, who is actually a big softie. He comes from no money. His parents disowned him a long time ago, so he has severe attachment issues. As in, he falls in love a lot. He is married to a lovely girl. A nurse. OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ BOBO ]
Male, 16-28 years old. Royalty. Bobo’s dad is The Chief of Staff for the President of Korea. They don’t really like to talk about their son in public. They’re not ashamed, per se, but they would really rather he move on from this and become a doctor, a lawyer, a politician. Really, anything but being in a boy band… OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ JOEY ]
Male, 16-28 years old. The chubby one. Adorable. Panda cheeks, like Harry Styles. Hardworking, sensitive. He loves to journal. On the internet. He’s an excellent lyricist. Girls love him for all those reasons. He seems genuinely kind and genuinely accessible. He is currently the face of anti-bacterial hand soaps in Korea. He is just oh-so-cute and in love with EPIC. OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ K-STYLE ]
Male, 16-28 years old. The Joey Fatone. He tries really hard. Just look at his name. There is one thing standing in his way, though: genetics. Everyone in the group loves him. He is older – could be anywhere between 28 to 40 – and he advises everyone like a good older brother slash father. Honestly, he could drop dead in the middle of a concert and you wouldn’t even know it. OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ 2T-2T (TOOT TOOT) ]
Male, 16-28 years old. Lance Bass. Except not gay. So, unexceptional in every way, really. He made headlines last year because he started dating a girl named Song-Mee, a big Korean drama star. They plan on breaking up, getting back together, getting engaged, and having a storybook wedding within the next two years. He is Moon’s nephew. OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
[ ORACLE ]
Male, 16-28 years old. The next in line. Platinum blond hair, Rick Owens everything. He’s the JC to EPIC’s Justin. He’s talented. Girls love him second best. He is second best at everything, in fact. And it drives him fucking crazy. He and EPIC are best friends publicly. They go shopping together, they vacation together, they eat together… He hates EPIC. OF KOREAN, KOREAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, OR ASIAN-AMERICAN DESCENT.
